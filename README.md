# Travlr Website

I created this project so that I could learn more about fullstack development. This project is broken up into modules, with each module having its own branch. This was created using MEAN stack development.

Module 1: Created the website and installed the  static web files. 

Module 2: Created the web application folders, controllers/routes, and handlebar views. 

Module 3: Moved static HTML to templates with JSON

Module 4: Installed and configured Mongoose and seeded the database. (NoSQL)

Module 5: Created the Mongoose schema and database acess code. Also tested teh access code and modified public website to use API endpoints.

Module 6: Created the Angular admin side, trip listing components, refactorsed trip rendering logic into Angular and created trip data services in addition to the ability to add/edit trips.

Module 7: Added authentication to Express backend as well as to the Angular front end.
